# aoc2022

This is my attempt at the Advent of code 2022.

My goal is try and only work with the Buffer. I do not know much about the Buffer, but so this
will be a great opportunity.

Download input to input files

```bash
curl https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/<Day>/input --cookie "session=<Session> > ./src/input/<day>_input.txt"
```
